Start Position:
Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides. Stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart.\n
Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged. This posture sets the foundation for maintaining balance throughout the exercise.\n

Step Forward:
Take a step forward with your right foot. The stride should be long enough that when you lower your body into a lunge, both your knees are at approximately 90-degree angles.\n

Lunge Down:
Bend both knees simultaneously, lowering your body toward the ground.\n
Your front knee should be positioned directly above your ankle, and your back knee should hover just above the floor without touching it.\n

Push Back:
Push through the heel of your front foot to stand back up.\n
As you rise, bring your back foot forward and take a step to continue the walking lunge.\n

Repeat:
Continue this walking motion, alternating legs with each step.\n
Perform the desired number of lunges or cover a specific distance.\n

Adjust the weight and repetitions based on your fitness level. If you’re a beginner, start with lighter weights and fewer repetitions and gradually increase the intensity over time.\n
